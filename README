This is a repo for vps hosting utilities, let it be any kind of virtual private server
These utilities can be used for their purposes but the outcome of running these
utilities is not our responsibility, check the code and make sure it's doing what you want it to do.

Inside this repo there should be a directory for each utilitiy,
simply clone it and you'll have hopefully a ton of tools at your fingertips for your vps 
experience.

ENJOY!
