This script will go through /var/www/ and scan each directory for vulnerable 
timthumb.php scripts. They can either be named timthumb.php or thumb.php

This will check the version it's currently running and if it's less than 
2.8 it will take in the old cache directory of the script and try 
to replace it in the new one it's replacing it with.

You should end up with an extra file called timthumb.php.old which 
will contain all of your old information.

To run this do the following

user@remote:~/$ python timthumb-vps.py --log ~/timthumb.log

You can always run with --help to get help.

By default this will log to /var/log/timthumb.log
